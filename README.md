# Grid-Forming-Inverters-under-Cyber-Attacks
Project about understanding how GFI behave under a suddenly cyber-attack
Hi all, 

The first file you should open is Script_4DGs_30_01_22, where it contains all the parameters and variables of the micro-grid that are used on our simulink files. 
The second file that has to be opened is GFC_22_3_22, because it containts the micro-grid and the observer that was used on our mitigation strategy. 
Finally, FDI_mitigation_strategy is the scenario where an FDI attack is introduced and is mitigate thanks to our theoretical framework.
